# Jarvis-AI-voice-assistant

Jarvis is a voice-powered assistant built with Python. It listens to your voice commands and responds or performs tasks accordingly. This project is a simple, modular setup designed to help you understand how voice interfaces work and how Python can be used to automate actions on your computer. Great for beginners experimenting with speech recognition, text-to-speech, and custom command systems.

# Jarvis – A Python Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a personal voice assistant made using Python. It listens to your voice, understands what you’re asking, and responds out loud or performs an action. Think of it as a small step towards building your own smart assistant like Siri or Alexa — but open-source and customizable.

## 🚀 What It Can Do

- Understand voice commands using speech recognition
- Reply using a computer-generated voice
- Perform custom tasks (open apps, say time, run scripts, etc.)
- Easily add your own commands and responses

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3.x**
- [`speech_recognition`](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [`pyttsx3`](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
- [`playsound`](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/)
- Standard Python libraries like `datetime`, `os`, and more



## ⚙️ How to Set It Up

1. **Clone the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
```

2. **Install the dependencies**

Make sure you’re using Python 3, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you face issues with `playsound`, try:
> ```bash
> pip install playsound==1.2.2
> ```

3. **Run the assistant**

```bash
python main.py
```

Speak into your mic and see Jarvis respond!

## 🎯 Customize It

Want Jarvis to do more? You can add your own commands in `engine/commands.py` and set new triggers or responses in `config.py`. The structure is modular so you can tweak it easily.

## 🔮 Ideas for Future Updates

- Add a GUI interface
- Integrate with APIs like weather, news, etc.
- Make it multi-lingual
- Add memory so Jarvis remembers your preferences
